# What is Darakson
Darakson is iOS application that aims to teach children basic programming language, with the help of a physical car.
Learning and viewing your outputs on a physical car seems more exiting then just staring at a screen!

## Feauters in Darakson

The user plays with car by navigating it around and having a view of what the car's camera lense is capturing.<br/>
Darakson provides some developer games that include:
  * Tic Tac Toe
  * Drive the car
  * Guess My Movie
  * Matching game
  
The Learn feautre is divided into levels.

Currently the first level is aiming to teach the concept of `print()` by showing a nice friendly robot to human dialog and printing words within the `print()` function onto the car screen.<br/>
